A patient uploads their photo and answers several questions. After that, proprietary AI-driven algorithms analyze their skin type and other characteristics and connect the client with a doctor. The doctor produces a skin care product (i.e. serum), tailored to the client's needs, from Universkin's ingredients. Then, the client receives the product, which specifically matches their skin type, by post.While working on this platform, our team of Pharma industry software experts, in close collaboration with the customer, gathered and analyzed tech requirements, developed the front-end and back-end parts, integrated the customer's AI into the back-end, tuned all notifications, and implemented communication channels.",
